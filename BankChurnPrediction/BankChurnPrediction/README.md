Bank Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a bank customer is likely to leave the bank (churn) or not using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to help banks identify customers at risk and take preventive actions.

## Dataset
- Customer banking dataset
- Features include:
  - Credit score
  - Age
  - Balance
  - Number of products
  - Active member status
  - Estimated salary
- Target variable:
  - Churn (1 = Customer leaves, 0 = Customer stays)

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and feature selection
3. Train-test split
4. Model training using Machine Learning algorithms
5. Model evaluation using accuracy metrics

## Model Used
- Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest (as applicable)

## Model Performance
- Accuracy: 81.4%

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.10
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
